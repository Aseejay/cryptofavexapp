          <h4>FOREWORD</h4>
          <p>
            Favex Technology Limited conducts business in the Federal Republic
            of Nigeria and is committed to assisting the fight against money
            laundering [ML] and terrorist financing [TF], by operating an
            effective risk-based approach.
          </p>
          <p>
            By doing so, the company will seek to maintain compliance with
            legislative and regulatory requirements. This policy actively
            manages risks associated with money laundering and terrorist
            financing, and through risk mitigants, aims to prevent, detect, and
            report suspicions of money laundering and terrorist financing.

          <h4>PURPOSE</h4>
          <p>
            This policy sets out Favex Technology Limited principles and
            measures adopted to ensure that the firm adheres to applicable laws
            and regulatory requirements about combating money laundering,
            corruption, and terrorist financing. This document describes the
            degree of due diligence to be applied when establishing, managing,
            monitoring, and declassifying/terminating business relationships at
            the various stages of the client relationship lifespan.
          </p>
          <p>
            This document requires that the firm complies with the following
            basic principles:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              We do not accept funds that we know or are expected to know are
              proceeds of criminal activities.
            </li>
            <li>
              We do not enter or maintain business relationships with shell
              banks (a Financial Institution with no physical presence in any
              country).
            </li>
            <li>
              We must always determine the identity of a contracting party and
              beneficial owners in respect of a transaction.
            </li>
            <li>
              A risk-based approach is applied throughout clients’ relationship
              lifespan.
            </li>
            <li>
              We undertake additional investigations for business relationships
              and transactions with increased risks.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>For employees, the main objectives of this policy are to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Enhance awareness of all employees (especially those in
              higher-risk roles) of the money laundering and financing terrorism
              risks the business faces.
            </li>
            <li>
              Enable staff to follow a Risk-Based Approach in mitigating money
              laundering (ML) and terrorism financing (FT) risks, and provide
              reasonable assurance that the firm does not accept assets that it
              knows or should reasonably be expected to know are proceeds of
              crime.
            </li>
            <li>
              Ensure that the firm remains compliant with all relevant money
              laundering legislation and regulation.
            </li>
            <li>
              Define a framework for staff encountering suspicious activity,
              transactions, or behaviour to escalate/notify the Money Laundering
              Compliance Officer (MLCO) or Compliance Department.
            </li>
            <li>
              Retain the confidence of the Organization’s key stakeholders,
              including regulators and law enforcement agencies.

          <p>

            purposes. The policy applies to all employees of the firm and each

            Non-adherence to any part of this policy may lead to disciplinary
            action, up to including dismissal. This policy does not intend to
            discourage any business area from engaging in activities that may be
            perceived as higher risk, but simply ensures that any such
            relationships can be engaged in a manner that safeguards the
            integrity and reputation of the financial industry and the firm.

          <h4>CLIENT/CUSTOMER DUE DILIGENCE MEASURES</h4>
          <p>
            <strong>Who is our client?</strong> One of the most important ways
            in which money laundering can be prevented is by establishing the
            identity of clients prior to commencing a business relationship with
            them. So, we must identify who the underlying client/s is/are. You
            must Know Your Customer (KYC). In some complex arrangements you may
            wish to seek advice from the Money Laundering Compliance Officer,
            but generally, the relationship will be clear.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Know your clients (KYC) requirements:</strong>
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Help the firm, at the time the client’s due diligence is carried
              out, to be reasonably satisfied that customers are who they say
              they are, to know whether they are acting on behalf of others, and
              whether there are any government sanctions against serving the
              client.
            </li>
            <li>
              Assist law enforcement with information on customers or activities
              under investigation.
            </li>
            <li>
              The client must be identified as soon as reasonably practicable
              after first contact with us and then verified promptly. In most
              cases, we will obtain this information before processing a
              financial transaction.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Where a client cannot be verified satisfactorily the matter must be
            brought to the attention of the Money Laundering Compliance Officer.
            The unwillingness of the client to undergo the due diligence process
            may be a factor for suspicion.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div className="company-info">
          <h4>RECORD KEEPING</h4>
          <p>
            The money laundering Regulations require firms to retain records
            concerning Clients’ identification and transactions for use as
            evidence in any possible future investigation.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our client on-boarding documents facilitate the establishment of the
            identity and verification of the Client and it is the firm’s policy
            to retain copies of such documents for six (6) years after the
            relationship with the Client has ended.
          </p>

          <p>The full scope of records to be maintained should cover:</p>

        <div className="company-info">
          <h4>MEASURES TAKEN</h4>
          <p>
            In cases where Favex Technology suspects that a transaction is
            related to money laundering or other criminal activities, the
            company will act in accordance with applicable laws and report any
            suspicious activity to the regulatory authorities. Favex Technology
            Limited reserves the right to suspend any client operation
            considered illegal or potentially related to money laundering, at
            the discretion of its staff. The company also has the authority to
            temporarily block a suspicious client account or terminate an
            existing client relationship.
