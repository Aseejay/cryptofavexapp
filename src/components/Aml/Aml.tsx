that the documents, date or information held evidencing the customer's identity are kept up
to date.
The following are examples of changes in a customer's situation that may be considered
suspicious:
A sudden increase in business from an existing customer;
Uncharacteristic transactions which are not in keeping with the customer's known
activities;
Peaks of activity at particular locations or at particular times;
Unfamiliar or untypical types of customer or transaction.
Whenever there is cause for suspicion, the customer will be asked to identify and verify the
source or destination of the transactions, whether they be individuals or company beneficial
owners.

preceding year been entrusted with a prominent public function by a state or Country other
than Nigeria, a community institution or an international body' or a family member or known
close associate of such a person.'
Individuals who have, or have had, a high political profile, or hold, or have held, public o@ice,
can pose a higher money laundering risk to Favex as their position makes them vulnerable
to corruption. This risk also extends to members of their immediate families and to known
close associates. PEP status itself does not, of course, incriminate individuals or entities. It
may, however, put a customer into a higher risk category.
An individual is not considered to be a PEP, after he has left o@ice for one year.
Enhanced Due Diligence Checks have been specifically designed for dealing with Politically
Exposed Persons, high-risk or high-net worth customers and large transactions
They take into consideration all relevant adverse information. Whether an o@icial document
or something posted publicly on the Internet, any information that pertains to money
laundering and financing of terrorism is thoroughly considered.`,
